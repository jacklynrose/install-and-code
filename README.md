# install-and-code

## Designed for...

- Cloud editing! I love Github codespaces and so I lean into VS Code
- Quick start coding - I struggle getting the motivation to get past setting up a repo so this is an easy go to
- Consistency
    - strong linting of code and structure
    - leaning deeply into the tools used (e.g. Yarn, Typescript, ESLint)
    - encouraging testing by making it easy and fast
    - all in one place with monorepos to make code sharing easy especially for domain concepts
    - federated GraphQL gateway to make it easy to bring data into one place
